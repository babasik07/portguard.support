<p><strong>Fees/Payment</strong></p>

<p>When a customer agrees to utilize one or more Tech to Us services, it is the customer’s obligation to provide payment prior to the service being initiated. The customer bears the right to refuse payment for the services, but Tech to Us then bears the right to refuse service to that individual or individuals.</p>

Otherwise, Tech to Us bears the right to refuse service to the customer.</p>

In those situations, Tech to Us and it’s payment processors are able to submit an updated expiration date for expired cards. Most issuing banks will accept the updated expiration date on recurring transactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, most banks support new features such as “Account Updater” which will allow Tech to Us and it’s credit card processors to get updated card information, including new, updated card numbers and expiration dates.</p>
<p>Simply letting your card expire or having your old card number canceled and reissued does not count as a cancellation of services. If you wish to cancel services, you must inform Tech to Us so that your account can be properly canceled to avoid future charges to your card.</p>

But support expands to “any technology that assists a computer or other technology device in performing one or more functions”. This includes, but is not limited to, support for issues such as viruses and malware, routers and modems, and assistance with software packages such as Antivirus software. As new technology arises, it is left to the discretion of Tech to Us if any other technologies will be added to the scope of support. Tech to Us reserves the right to decline service for any issue, device, product, or item for any reason at our discretion.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Designed Software</strong></p>
<p>Tech to Us may use custom-designed software and scripts to assist in resolving an issue, reporting data system information, or automating a task. Such software may be manufactured by Tech to Us or manufactured by a Third-party (see section titled “Third-party Software”). To the best knowledge of Tech to Us, the software is fully licensed and breaks no laws when it is used on a customer’s device.</p>
<p>Tech to Us is not responsible for the unlikely scenario of such software causing damage to your device’s hardware or software. How the technician proceeds if this occurs is at the discretion of the support technician, supervisor, and/or manager.</p>
<p>Tech to Us may accept End User License Agreements on your behalf – for any Tech to Us designed software.</p>
<p><strong>Non-genuine Ink or Toner</strong></p>
<p>Tech to Us cannot guarantee the operability of any printers when utilizing third-party or non-genuine ink or toner cartridges.</p>
<p><strong>Data Backup and Data Loss</strong></p>
<p>Tech to Us will make their “best-effort” to salvage and secure any important data on a customer’s device or notify the customer of a situation where data may be lost. However, Tech to Us is not responsible for notifying the customer of potential data loss, backing up data, the loss of any data, or the failure/inability to retrieve previously backed up data, by the Tech to Us Backup Service or any other method. Unforeseen issues may occur and Tech to Us is not responsible for these situations during the course of our troubleshooting and support process. It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that their data is properly backed up before engaging in any support or troubleshooting with Tech to Us.</p>
<p>Failure to maintain current payment for any plan which includes data backup services provided by Tech to Us will automatically forfeit access to existing data backups completed by the Tech to Us Backup Service. Data backups will be deleted upon cancellation or non-payment of services. The customer does not own perpetual rights to their backed up data. Data is only accessible through the data backup service while the customer is a current, paying data backup service subscriber. Tech to Us will also cease to complete any additional data backups.</p>
<p>Any data loss or data backups missed are not the responsibility of Tech to Us for any reason.</p>
<p>Tech to Us maintains a “soft” data cap. When you exceed your allotted data storage cap, Tech to Us will reach out to you to alert you. If you are unable to rectify the overage yourself or with our assistance by either limiting what you are backing up, increasing your support plan to one that includes additional data storage, or adding on additional storage (in the case of a “Diamond” plan), Tech to Us reserves the right to delete your data backup account along with all associated backed up data. Any data backed up will be permanently lost and is not retrievable under any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Software</strong></p>
<p>Oftentimes, Tech to Us will use “third-party software” to assist in resolving an issue. “Third-party software” is software that is not manufactured by Tech to Us. Examples of this software are virus and malware removal tools. To the best knowledge of Tech to Us, the software is fully licensed and breaks no laws when it is used on a customer’s device.</p>
<p>Tech to Us is not responsible for the unlikely scenario of third-party software causing damage to your device’s hardware or software. How the technician proceeds if this occurs is at the discretion of the support technician, supervisor, and/or manager.</p>
<p>Tech to Us may accept End User License Agreements on your behalf – for third party software and any Tech to Us branded software.</p>
<p><strong>Remote Assistance</strong></p>
<p>Tech to Us uses third-party remote assistance software to help resolve most customer issues. Remote assistance software allows the technician to remotely control a customer’s device to expedite the steps needed to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>This software is fully licensed and breaks no laws when it is used on a customer’s device.</p>
<p>The software installs a small piece of software on the customer’s device. While the software is typically harmless, Tech to Us bears no responsibility for unforeseen negative effects that the software has on the customer’s device.</p>
<p>A functioning internet connection is required on the device in which the technician intends to take remote control of. The lack of internet connectivity or a slow internet connection can make remote assistance impossible. In this scenario, the customer will need to follow the technician’s instructions to restore the device’s internet connection for the purpose of eventual remote control.</p>
<p>The customer bears the right to refuse a remote connection to their device. But the customer must then understand that without remote assistance, the resolution of the issue will take longer and require more customer interaction.</p>
<p>Tech to Us also bears the right to refuse service, at its sole discretion, if a customer chooses to refuse a remote assistance connection.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation policy</strong></p>
<p>The customer may cancel standard service offerings at any time. However, cancellation of a service does not necessarily entitle the customer to a refund. Please see the “Refund Policy” section for more information.</p>
<p>From time to time Tech to Us may offer a service option that requires a commitment, either written or verbal, to pay and/or keep the service active for a specific period of time. During this time, the customer cannot cancel the service as per the binding written or verbal agreement. Any payments required to be made must continue for the duration of the agreed-upon time. At which time the agreed upon time frame has ended, the customer is allowed to cancel their service. The cancellation of service does not necessarily entitle the customer to a refund. Please see the “Refund Policy” section for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Refund policy</strong></p>
<p>The customer bears to the right to receive a refund if the service process has not yet been initiated. This implies that absolutely no steps have been taken by the Tech to Us technician to resolve the customer’s issue or to answer the customer’s question(s). If the customer receives a refund at this time, Tech to Us bears the right to refuse further service to that customer.</p>
<p>Tech to Us provides a “100% money-back guarantee” on the initial incident. “Initial incident” implies a situation where a customer is calling in for the first time with a specific computer or technology problem or question(s). It is the responsibility of the Tech to Us technician to resolve the problem and/or answer the question(s) accurately. The technician must be allowed all opportunities to resolve the issue. What is considered “all opportunities” varies depending on the nature of the issue and will be defined at the discretion of a Tech to Us technician, agent, supervisor, and/or manager. If the technician is unable to fully resolve the customer’s’ problem, or answer the question(s) after exhausting all possible methods of a resolution, a full refund may be issued. The customer does not have the option to end support in order to receive a refund prior to Tech to Us finding a solution or exhausting all opportunities to resolve the issue. The support process must be allowed to be fully vetted in order for a refund to be considered, regardless of the reason. In a situation where Tech to Us has resolved at least one (1) issue, even if it was not the initial incident, the money-back guarantee is no longer valid and the customer is not entitled to a refund for any services – either fully or partially.</p>
<p>Tech to Us cannot guarantee the timeframe of how long a refund will take to credit back to a customer’s card. It is typically 5-7 business days, however, Tech to Us has no control over of the time-frame after Tech to Us has processed the refund.</p>
<p>The customer has the option to cancel any recurring support options. A refund for already billed services is not allowed. In the case of a cancellation, the remaining duration of the customer’s service plan will be honored and future billings will cease – the technical support service is then no longer active at the end of the last billing term. Tech to Us does not provide partial or pro-rated refunds for time unused. Refunds are not allowed in cases of a failure to resolve issues outside of the initial billing of any service option.</p>
<p>If Tech to Us determines that an operating system reinstall is necessary to properly fix the issue(s) at hand; a refund will not be provided if the customer chooses not to continue or if the customer does not have proper legal working copies of any software that may be installed on the device or may be required for the device to fully work properly. This includes, but is not limited to, operating systems, drivers, and applications (or “apps”).</p>
<p>In the event a Tech to Us repair disc or repair USB drive is needed to properly fix the issue(s) at hand; a customer’s refusal of the usage of this disc or USB drive is not an acceptable reason for a refund.</p>
<p>Tech to Us must be directly contacted to cancel any ongoing service. A dispute with the customer’s credit card company or bank is not a notification of cancellation nor is it a valid reason for any credit or refund.</p>
<p>Tech to Us reserves the right to cancel, refund or suspend service for any reason. In cases of service cancellations, Tech to Us will fairly assess the situation and provide refunds when appropriate.</p>
<p>Failure of the data backup process, failure of data to be properly backed up, or any other data loss or retrieval issue is not grounds for the refund of any services.</p>
<p>Failure of hardware, components, and accessories after the initial incident are not grounds for a refund. Tech to Us will continue to support any other current technology or replacement technology. Future forfeiture of any customer hardware is also not grounds for a refund of any service fees paid either fully or partially.</p>
